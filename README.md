## An Umbraco plugin to toggle display of unpublished backoffice nodes

If you're anything like me, you have a habit of littering your Umbraco install with unpublished content nodes - you create content in advance and schedule the publish, or unpublish content only to republish it at a later date. You're a hoarder who doesn't like deleting content.

Think of the children! can help - the plugin adds a new option to the context menu in the content tree. Click it once, unpublished content is hidden. Click it again, and behold, the hidden children return! 

If this doesn't help you sleep better at night, I don't know what will. Note: if unpublished Umbraco nodes have you losing sleep, you should talk to someone. I'm not a doctor, but seriously.
